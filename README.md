### 📈 BJKST and ToW Comparison

**BJKST vs Exact F0**  
The BJKST algorithm provides a fast and memory-efficient approximation of the F0 norm quite accurately. On both local and GCP runs, BJKST produced estimates very close to the exact value (7,864,320 vs 7,406,649 locally; 7,278,592 vs 7,406,649 on GCP). This shows BJKST performs well with appropriate bucket size and number of trials, achieving less than 10% error. But on GCP the runtime was significantly longer than local runs because of the cluster overhead.

**Tug-of-War vs Exact F2**  
The ToW algorithm approximates the second frequency moment differs a lot depending on the width you set it at (there is a high variance between a depth of 1 vs depth of 10 but depth of 1 runs faster). At low width/depth (width=1, depth=1), the approximation was extremely poor and unstable (e.g., 13M locally vs 8.5B exact), highlighting sensitivity to parameter tuning. Increasing width and depth (e.g., width=10, depth=3) significantly improved the estimate (6.5B locally, 8.5B on GCP), demonstrating that higher parameter values improve accuracy at the cost of runtime. Basically, ToW can approximate F2 well, but requires careful tuning to reduce variance.



## Getting started
Head to [Project 1](https://github.com/CSCI3390Spring2025/project_1) if you're looking for information on Git, template repositories, or setting up your local/remote environments.

## Resilient distributed datasets in Spark
This project will familiarize you with RDD manipulations by implementing some of the sketching algorithms the course has covered thus far.  

You have been provided with the program's skeleton, which consists of 5 functions for computing either F0 or F2: the BJKST, tidemark, tug-of-war, exact F0, and exact F2 algorithms. The tidemark and exact F0 functions are given for your reference.

## Relevant data

You can find the TAR file containing `2014to2017.csv` [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MtCimcVKN6JrK2sLy4GbjeS7E2a-UMA0/view?usp=sharing). Download and expand the TAR file for local processing. For processing in the cloud, refer to the steps for creating a storage bucket in [Project 1](https://github.com/CSCI3390Spring2025/project_1) and upload `2014to2017.csv`.

`2014to2017.csv` contains the records of parking tickets issued in New York City from 2014 to 2017. You'll see that the data has been cleaned so that only the license plate information remains. Keep in mind that a single car can receive multiple tickets within that period and therefore appear in multiple records.  

**Hint**: while implementing the functions, it may be helpful to copy 100 records or so to a new file and use that file for faster testing.  

## Calculating and reporting your findings
You'll be submitting a report along with your code that provides commentary on the tasks below.  

1. **(3 points)** Implement the `exact_F2` function. The function accepts an RDD of strings as an input. The output should be exactly `F2 = sum(Fs^2)`, where `Fs` is the number of occurrences of plate `s` and the sum is taken over all plates. This can be achieved in one line using the `map` and `reduceByKey` methods of the RDD class. Run `exact_F2` locally **and** on GCP with 1 driver and 4 machines having 2 x N1 cores. Copy the results to your report. Terminate the program if it runs for longer than 30 minutes.
2. **(3 points)** Implement the `Tug_of_War` function. The function accepts an RDD of strings, a parameter `width`, and a parameter `depth` as inputs. It should run `width * depth` Tug-of-War sketches, group the outcomes into groups of size `width`, compute the means of each group, and then return the median of the `depth` means in approximating F2. A 4-universal hash function class `four_universal_Radamacher_hash_function`, which generates a hash function from a 4-universal family, has been provided for you. The generated function `hash(s: String)` will hash a string to 1 or -1, each with a probability of 50%. Once you've implemented the function, set `width` to 10 and `depth` to 3. Run `Tug_of_War` locally **and** on GCP with 1 driver and 4 machines having 2 x N1 cores. Copy the results to your report. Terminate the program if it runs for longer than 30 minutes. **Please note** that the algorithm won't be significantly faster than `exact_F2` since the number of different cars is not large enough for the memory to become a bottleneck. Additionally, computing `width * depth` hash values of the license plate strings requires considerable overhead. That being said, executing with `width = 1` and `depth = 1` should generally still be faster.
3. **(3 points)** Implement the `BJKST` function. The function accepts an RDD of strings, a parameter `width`, and a parameter `trials` as inputs. `width` denotes the maximum bucket size of each sketch. The function should run `trials` sketches and return the median of the estimates of the sketches. A template of the `BJKSTSketch` class is also included in the sample code. You are welcome to finish its methods and apply that class or write your own class from scratch. A 2-universal hash function class `hash_function(numBuckets_in: Long)` has also been provided and will hash a string to an integer in the range `[0, numBuckets_in - 1]`. Once you've implemented the function, determine the smallest `width` required in order to achieve an error of +/- 20% on your estimate. Keeping `width` at that value, set `depth` to 5. Run `BJKST` locally **and** on GCP with 1 driver and 4 machines having 2 x N1 cores. Copy the results to your report. Terminate the program if it runs for longer than 30 minutes.
4. **(1 point)** Compare the BJKST algorithm to the exact F0 algorithm and the tug-of-war algorithm to the exact F2 algorithm. Summarize your findings.

## Submission via GitHub
Delete your project's current **README.md** file (the one you're reading right now) and include your report as a new **README.md** file in the project root directory. Have no fear—the README with the project description is always available for reading in the template repository you created your repository from. For more information on READMEs, feel free to visit [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-readmes) in the GitHub Docs. You'll be writing in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown). Be sure that your repository is up to date and you have pushed all changes you've made to the project's code. When you're ready to submit, simply provide the link to your repository in the Canvas assignment's submission.

## You must do the following to receive full credit:
